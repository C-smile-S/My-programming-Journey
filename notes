Now for bootstrap responsiveness, pay attention to the following


> .col-(extra small 		devices - screen width less than 576px)

> .col-sm- (small devices- screen width equal to or greater 576px)

>	.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to o greater than 768px)

> .col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)

>	.col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px )


so the code is being used as a value of an attribute how the code is being used goes as such
<div class="col-md-6"></div>   though i am not sure if ig can only be used on class or some other attribute and also the "6" represents the number ofg grid we have which is 12 BTW
